# PBB

**Code from the PBB class [Fall 2020]**

Language: Python

_This class was my first programming class in a general-purpose programming language and served as an introduction to programming concepts._

The course covered the folowing concepts:

| Week(s) | Concepts                  |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| 1       | Intro                     |
| 2       | Input/Output              |
| 3 - 4   | Variables and Expressions |
| 5 - 6   | Decisions                 |
| 7 - 8   | Loops                     |
| 9 - 10  | Lists                     |
| 11 - 12 | Files                     |
| 13      | Function Basics           |

The class followed a 2-week pattern of a checkpoint and a team activity every week and a coding assignment every 2 weeks.

The class encouraged students to add something extra, so many ofr the assignments exceed the original assignment's requirements.
