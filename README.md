# PBB

**Code from the PBB class [Fall 2020]**

**Language:** Python
**Prerequisites:** None

_This class was my first programming class in a general-purpose programming language and served as an introduction to programming concepts._

The course covered the following concepts:

| Week(s) | Concepts                  |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| 1       | Intro                     |
| 2       | Input/Output              |
| 3 - 4   | Variables and Expressions |
| 5 - 6   | Decisions                 |
| 7 - 8   | Loops                     |
| 9 - 10  | Lists                     |
| 11 - 12 | Files                     |
| 13      | Function Basics           |

The class followed a 2-week pattern of a checkpoint and a team activity every week and a coding assignment every 2 weeks.

The class encouraged students to add something extra, so many ofr the assignments exceed the original assignment's requirements.

The code in this repository does not include all of the code made in this class, just many of the important assignments that I still have. They are as follows:

| Week(s) | Type          | Program               |
